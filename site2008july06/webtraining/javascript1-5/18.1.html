<h1>Welcome to this page</h1>
<p>The above heading is red, since we specified that H1-H3 headers are red.  This paragraph is blue, which is the default color for the entire body. It's also centered and has 20% margins, which we specified as the default for paragraphs.</p>
<p style="color:black">This paragraph has black text, because it overrides the default color in the paragraph tag.  We didn't override the centering so this paragraph is also centered.</p>
<ul>
<li>this is a bullet list</li>
<li>It's green and bold, because we specified those defaults for bullet lists</li>
<li style="color:red">This item is red, overriding the default.</li>
<li>This item is back to normal.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is another paragraph witht he default paragraph style.</p>
