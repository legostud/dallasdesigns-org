	<h2>The Best Family Movie <em>Ever</em></h2>
	<p>The movie <cite>Babe</cite> was the best family movie ever produced!  This great movie featured
	talking animals, a cantankerous old man, and subtle-yet-Oscar-winning special effects - - who could
	ask for more?  The clever writing and humorous touches make this all-ages movie great for children
	while still very enjoyable by adults.  Feel like a kid again - - see <cite>Babe</cite>!
