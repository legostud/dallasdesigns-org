    is my first web site project. My co-worker Sara was opening a new store and 
    was having trouble with the designer.I started the project with the Logos 
    and fonts already picked, but the overall look and feel of the site was still 
    undecided. After reviewing a few web sites of other companies that Sara liked, 
    I proposed a design that used the logo as the background. From there we kept 
    pushing the site to get a real punkish feel. I think the quirky alignment 
    of the links, the red background and the torn images all help make this site 
    really kickass.</p>

  <p>On November 17th and 18th NELUG displayed their LEGO Train Layout at the 
    Greenburg Toy and Train show. My wife and I contributed some of our buildings, 
    trains, cars, figures and helped arrange the layout. <a href="http://www.nelug.org/mediagallery/album.php?aid=317&page=1" target="_blank">More
