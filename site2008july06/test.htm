<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This auction is for two sealed booster 
  packs. I believe they are 5th edition, but since they are written in a foreign 
  language I'm not sure.</font></p>
  
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a chunk of hot glue stuck 
  on the back of each booster pack. They were attach to a piece of cardboard that 
  came with my subscription to Duelist.</font></p>
