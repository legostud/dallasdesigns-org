  <p>Since I was born, LEGO has been part of my life. Once I started high school 
    however, Lego just stopped being cool. There were more important things to 
    do. I was only able to complete one building during those four years; which 
    I still have today.</p>
  <p>From 1995 to 2001 is considered my dark ages. A time when LEGO wasn't part 
    of my life. When I started working for Pinpoint Corporation as a co-op student, 
    my dark ages ended when I needed to create a name tag to put on my cubicle. 
    For my cube, I decided to build a LEGO billboard with a minifig washing it 
    that said my name and title. Everyone there loved it.</p>
  <p>I then started searching the web for LEGO sites and found <a href="http://www.nelug.org">NELUG</a>, 
    a group of adult fans of LEGO (AFOLs). Since NELUG participates in the Greenburg 
    Toy and Train Show twice a year and does other events in between, they keep 
    me active. Without this group, I would have probably drifted back into my 
    dark age.</p>
  <p>You can find photos of my creations at the following sites:<br>
