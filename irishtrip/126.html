<h3>This is a photo of the the new road in Flemby.  It comes down from where tall Arthur West lived and Hester Hill lives, and where Mother was born and lived. Straight ahead is the new Tralee to Killarney Highway.  To get to Edna and short Arthur West's house, you would take a right onto the highway heading South, and their dairy farm is about a half mile to a mile down on the left.
