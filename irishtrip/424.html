<h3>Amanda (West) Tarrant on the Dingle Peninsula with the Atlantic Ocean behind her.  She very kindly drove us all around the Peninsula.  She also took us to Shannon Airport the day we left, a two-hour drive.  On the way, we stopped in Ballycannon, County Limerick to visit Bob & Joan West, Niall's parents.
