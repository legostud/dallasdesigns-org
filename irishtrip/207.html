<h3>Jessie and Vira with a fellow who was beside the road with his donkey and the donkey's baby.  He was at one of the stops on our tour around the Ring of Kerry. Vira enjoyed talking with him and asked for a photo.  She gave him a tip and he gave her some sprigs of Heather from his donkey's basket.
