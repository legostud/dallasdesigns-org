<h3>There is no longer a thatched roof on the cottage where our mother, Louise (West) Quigley, was born.  She lived there until she was almost eighteen when she and her mother, Avice Ellen (Murphy) West, came to the U.S. Louise's father and one brother, James Alfred West, stayed in Ireland and worked the farm.  James married Annie Poff and their son, tall Arthur West inherited it.  He built a new house beside it, so the old place has been unoccupied for years, hence the weeds and wild blackberry bushes.
