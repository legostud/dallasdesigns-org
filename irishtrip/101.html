<h3>Vira in Valetta Blennerhassett's home in Gortatlea, County Kerry.  Vira, Edna and I were invited to tea, coffee, cakes and scones.  The wedding picture on the wall is of her daughter, Vera.  Interesting candle holders are attached to each side of the piano to help one see better when reading the music.
