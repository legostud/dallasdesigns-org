<h3>Jessie & Hester Hill of Flemby, shown here, and Vira and Mary O'Sullivan had a lovely lunch at this restaurant situated next to the Tralee to Killarney Highway.  Hester drove us that day, and when we returned to her home, Edna & Arthur were there looking for us.  Vira's son, Mike, had phoned with the sad news that our brother, John  Quigley, had just passed away.  We flew home the next day and Vira stayed in Beverly to attend his services with the rest of the family.
