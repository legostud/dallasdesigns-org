<h3>When tall Arthur stopped cutting the turf by hand with a slane, he paid the man who owns this Lilliput Machine to do the cutting for him.  His equipment could cut peat out of the bog much faster.  Arthur still had to turn each piece over by hand for drying, but many times, Edna & Arthur's son, Trevor, would help him.
