<h3>Vira, at a museum in the Port of Cobh in County Cork.  She is pointing to a Cunard Line poster showing a steamship like the SS Andania, which brought our Mother and Grandmother from Cobh to Boston in 1914.  Cobh was previously named Queenstown until Ireland won their independence from Great Britain.   Mother's name was Louisa Marguerita West and she was almost 18 when she came over with her Mother, Avice Ellen (Murphy) West.  She changed the spelling to Louise Marguerite in America.
