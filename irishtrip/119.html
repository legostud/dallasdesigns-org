<h3>Vivien Blennerhassett and Edna West take time for a coffee break.  Vivien is married to Valetta's son, Alan.  They live across the highway from the Wests and have built a home on his parent's land.  Viv takes care of 60 cows and Alan has a haulage company.  They took over these companies when Tommy Blennerhassett retired.  Tommy passed away only a month before we arrived.
